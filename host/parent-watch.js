// An MCP server is only ever useful to the process that spawned it. When that
// process dies, this one should follow — and normally it does, because closing
// the last handle to our stdin gives us EOF. On this machine that failed often
// enough to leave 156 of these processes alive at once, holding ~9GB between
// them, some parented to PIDs Windows had already recycled onto unrelated
// programs.
//
// EOF is still the fast path and still fires on an abrupt parent kill (measured
// here at ~1s). What defeats it is a duplicated handle: if any other live
// process holds a copy of our stdin write end, the pipe never reaches EOF no
// matter what happened to our parent. Nothing we do on this side can close
// someone else's handle, so we need a signal that does not run through the pipe
// at all — hence watching the parent directly.
//
// The catch is that a PID is not an identity. Windows recycles them, and
// process.ppid is a snapshot taken at creation, so "is my parent still alive?"
// can be answered yes by a program that has nothing to do with us. The way out
// is that a recycled PID always belongs to a process created AFTER us: a real
// parent must be older than its child. So liveness is checked often and cheaply
// (a signal-0 probe), and identity is re-confirmed occasionally against that
// rule, which costs one query and cannot be fooled by reuse.
